    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>     Pizza is an unquestionable corner stone of cousine. One will be hard-pressed to find a corner of the world that has well-established connections to the global stage and is unfamiliar with this oriental dish mastered by the Italians.</p> <br>
   
    <p>     Simplistic, in its design, pizza is nonetheless versatile; with a base of bread, cheese, tomato sauce the world around has experimented and created countless variations. Chief amongst which would be the <em>Hawaiian Pizza</em> -- a dish infamous for its controversial reputation for mixing the sweetness of pineapple with the traditionally salty base dish.
